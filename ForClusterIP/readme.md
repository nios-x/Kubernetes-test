# ❓ Can you use ClusterIP to host a pod (i.e., access it from outside the cluster)?
# 🔴 No, you cannot use ClusterIP to expose pods externally.
## ClusterIP is the default and internal-only service type.

It only works inside the cluster — meaning:

Other pods can access it via DNS like backend-service.default.svc.cluster.local

You cannot visit it from your browser or curl localhost

✅ When is ClusterIP useful?
Scenario	ClusterIP Use
Microservice-to-microservice communication	✅ Yes
Backend talking to DB inside the cluster	✅ Yes
External client (browser, Postman, curl)	❌ No

🧪 Want to test a ClusterIP service locally?
Yes, you can — using:

    kubectl port-forward (temporary, manual access)

    kubectl port-forward service/backend-clusterip 8080:3000
    
    http://localhost:8080

That forwards your local port 8080 → service port 80 → pod port 3000 (via targetPort).
